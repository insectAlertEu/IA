    <h3>Lyme Disease</h3>

    <table id="descTable">
  <tr>
    <td><p><strong>Lyme disease</strong> is caused by bacteria <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks (in Europe mostly castor bean tick - <em>Ixodes Ricinus</em>, in USA by blacklegged tick - <em>Ixodes scapularis</em>).</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema" target="_blank"><img class="small" src="images/lymeDisease/erythemaMigrans.jpg" title="Erythema migrans"></a><strong>Symptoms</strong> of lyme disease are: fever, headache, fatigue and characteristic skyn rash called <em>erythema migrants</em>. Erythema migrans is a red circular rash that often appears at the site of the tick bite within 3 to 14 days after the bite. The rash grows. In some cases many rashes appear. Common sites are the thigs, groin, trunk and armpits. The rash not always occur as the effect of the lyme disease infection. Sometimes tick saliva can cause allergic reaction similar to the erythema migrans. Allergic reactions usually appear within hours to few days after the tick bite and disappear within few days. Untreated infection may spread to joints, the heart and the nervous system. These are signs of late lyme disease. Arthritis is most likely to appear as brief bouts of pain and swelling in one or more large joints like the knees. Nervous system symptoms include: numbness, pain, nerve paralysis and meningitis. Rarely, irregularities of the heart rythm may occur. Problems with memory or concentration, fatigue, headache and sleep disturbances sometimes persist after treatment.</p>
        <p>Be careful! Different people exhibit different signs of Lyme disease. Even erythema migrans not always appears. Additionaly, many of the symptoms of Lyme disease are similar to those of other diseases. The best way is to consult with your doctor for the best and correct diagnosis.</p>
        <p><strong>Diagnosis</strong> of Lyme disease takes into account the following factors:
        <ul><li>1. History of possible exposure to ticks in areas where
Lyme disease is known to occur.</li>
            <li>2. Signs and symptoms of the illness.</li>
            <li>3. The results of blood tests used to detect whether the
patient has antibodies to Lyme disease bacteria.</li></ul></p>
        <p>Blood tests measure antibodies against Lyme disease bacteria. It can take 4-6 weeks after infection for the body to produce significant for measure level of antibodies. Laboratory tests must be interpreted based in the length of infection.</p>
        <p><strong>Treatment</strong> of Lyme disease is based on the antibiotics. Patients treated in the early stage of disease usually recover rapidly and completly. In later stages of Lyme disease patients also respond well to antibiotics. Unrecognized Lyme disease may cause chronic illnes and permament damage to joints or the nervous system.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention</strong>. There is no vaccacine for Lyme disease. The best way to to be healthy is to avoid ticks which are spreading disease. To do that:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Avoid tick-infested areas</strong>. Avoid contact with overgrown grass, brush and leaf litter at trail edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Remember that ticks are especially active in May, June and July</strong> and all prevention methods are even more important in this months.</li>
            <li><strong>Use insect repellent</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Perform daily ticks checks</strong>. Ticks must usually be attached for at least one day before they can transmit the bacteria that cause Lyme disease and early removal can reduce the risk of infection.</li>
            <li><strong>Bathe or shower</strong>. Bathe of shower after coming indoors to wash off and more easily find ticks that are crawling on your body. After being outdoors, wash and dry clothing at high temperature to kill any ticks that may remain on clothing.</li>
            <li><strong>Wear clothes which are hidding your skin</strong> when you are going outdoor.</li>

    <h3>Tick-borne encephalitis</h3>

    <table id="descTable">
  <tr>
    <td><p><strong>Tickborne encephalitis</strong> or TBE, is a human viral infectious disease involving the central nervous system. TBE is caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, and was initially isolated in 1937. Three virus sub-types are described: European or Western tick-borne encephalitis virus, Siberian tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Far eastern Tick-borne encephalitis virus (formerly known as Russian Spring Summer encephalitis virus, RSSEV). In Europe it is transmitted to humans by castor bean tick (<em>Ixodes Ricinus</em>) bite. Ticks act as both vector and virus reservoir.</p>
        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong>. The incubation period of TBE is usually between 7 and 14 days and is asymptomatic. Shorter incubation times have been reported after milk-borne exposure.</p>

<p>In contrast to Far-eastern TBE, European TBE is more severe in adults than in children where meningitis is more frequently observed.</p>

<p>In approximately two-thirds of patients infected with the European TBE virus, only an early (viremic) phase is experienced; symptoms are nonspecific and may include fever, malaise, anorexia, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. After about 8 days of remission, a second phase of disease occurs in 20% to 30% of patients.  These patients may experience a clinical illness that involves the central nervous system with symptoms of meningitis (e.g., fever, headache, and a stiff neck), encephalitis (e.g., drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities such as paralysis), or meningoencephalitis.</p>

<p>The convalescent or recovery period can be long and the incidence of sequelae may vary between 30% and 60%, with long-term or even permanent neurologic symptoms. Neuropsychiatric sequelae have been reported in 10-20% of patients.</p>
        <p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>. During the first phase of the disease, the most common laboratory abnormalities are a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) and a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Liver enzymes in the serum may also be mildly elevated. After the onset of neurologic disease during the second phase, an increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually found. Virus can be isolated from the blood during the first phase of the disease. Laboratory diagnosis usually depends on detection of specific IgM in either blood or CSF, usually appearing later, during the second phase of the disease.</p>
        <p><strong>Tretment</strong>. There is no specific antiviral treatment for TBE.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention</strong>. Two inactivated cell culture-derived TBE vaccines are available in Europe, in adult and pediatric formulations: FSME-IMMUN (Baxter, Austria) and Encepur (Novartis, Germany).</p>
        <p>The other type of prevention is self-awarness:</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Avoid tick-infested areas</strong>. Avoid contact with overgrown grass, brush and leaf litter at trail edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Remember that ticks are especially active in May, June and July</strong> and all prevention methods are even more important in this months.</li>
            <li><strong>Use insect repellent</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Perform daily ticks checks</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Bathe or shower</strong>. Bathe of shower after coming indoors to wash off and more easily find ticks that are crawling on your body. After being outdoors, wash and dry clothing at high temperature to kill any ticks that may remain on clothing.</li>
            <li><strong>Wear clothes which are hidding your skin</strong> when you are going outdoor.</li>
