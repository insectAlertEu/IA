<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease" style="text-decoration:none; color: #28004d"><span style="color: #e60000">LYME DISEASE:</span> Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the Borrelia type. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness, known as erythema migrans, that begins at the site of a tick bite about a week after it has occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25-50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months.</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #e60000">Lyme Disease Danger Index:</span> Information about the probability of Lyme Disease infection on the highlighted administrative unit. Index of danger level 1000 is equal to 4 promiles of the area population infected which is the highest level for Poland.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e60000">Year of the last measurement:</span> Danger Index is based on the last available measurement of infected people. If the year is closer to the actual time the D.I. has higher quality.</p>
<p><span style="color: #e60000">The slope</span> is (usually) connected to measurements from many years or in some cases from just one year (in this case previous years are treated as 0-Danger Index and slope is overestimated). Slope is based on a linear trend, it's quality depends on the amount of measurements - the more measurements are made, the more accurate the index is. Slope value (-10) means that trend is falling down. Slope (0) means that the trend is stable. (+10) slope means that it is trending upwards - area with this slope value may be more dangerous year by year!</p>

<p>We choose Lyme Disease as the Danger Index because it is well documented by Polish Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations. Remember about safety in the voivodships and regions with high Lyme Disease Danger Index and/or Slope. <span style="color: #e60000">The medical information on our website is provided without any representations or warranties, express or implied.
